      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p align="justify">Every day we are surrounded by images and news of violence, conflict and protests. They flash before our eyes without us noticing; they become numbers, statistics, and we distance ourselves from them.
      But behind those figures there are people, places and lives that are changed forever.
      This project was born out of a desire to look beyond the numbers.
      Through data and visualisations, we want to tell a story that usually remains invisible: the complexity of conflicts and their human consequences.
      Because war never affects only those who experience it. It affects all of us as citizens, as observers, as human beings.
