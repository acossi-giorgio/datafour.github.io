Looking at the distribution of different types of violence across the region's countries reveals the full complexity of the context.
Some states experience constant tension, with protests and political violence recurring year after year. Others experience sudden peaks, moments when discontent or repression erupts forcefully.
The boxplot highlights these differences: the wider "boxes" represent countries where instability is chronic, while the narrower ones signal rare but violent crises.
The attacks against civilians and the resulting casualties add another layer of drama, showing how violence spreads irregularly but steadily.
Overall, these patterns reveal not only the region's political fragility, but also its human cost: a volatility that continues to impact the lives of millions.
