      The histograms show how the number of attacks and abductions has changed over the years in Syria and Palestine.<br>
      We observe a divergent trend in Syria: while direct attacks have gradually decreased in recent years, cases of abduction and forced disappearance have increased.
      This change suggests a transformation in the dynamics of the conflict: violence has become more silent, aimed at greater control over the population.<br>
      In Palestine, on the other hand, the number of attacks has increased over time, with a clear peak during the period of greatest tension. Abductions, by contrast, are concentrated only in two specific periods, 2020 and 2024, highlighting isolated but significant episodes.
