      As the blood flows, so does the resistance. Protests, both peaceful and
      violent, are increasing across almost all countries. It is proof that the
      population does not remain helpless in the face of violence: society,
      despite taking many risks, is looking for a space to make its voice heard.
      The streets have become the other face of the conflict.
