      Moving from the number of attacks to the actual number of victims, the
      tragedy becomes even clearer. The numbers fluctuate, but in some years
      they explode. Each peak in the charts corresponds to waves of attacks,
      offensives, or bombings that indiscriminately affect the population. The
      visualizations expose the human dimension of the conflict. The graphs show
      the differences between countries, but also a sad common trend: the loss
      of civilian life continues to grow over time, concentrated in areas
      already devastated by war.

      As the blood flows, so does the resistance. Protests, both peaceful and
      violent, are increasing across almost all countries. It is proof that the
      population does not remain helpless in the face of violence: society,
      despite taking many risks, is looking for a space to make its voice heard.
      The streets have become the other face of the conflict.
