      Now let's look at the topics covered in the first chapter from a temporal perspective.<br />The graphs show the evolution of the main forms of violence: political violence events, protests, events targeting civilians and civilian fatalities.
      <br />We observe that, while most other countries have remained stable or even decreased, Palestine has seen a tragic increase in violent events and attacks against civilians in recent years. This increase is also reflected in a significant rise in civilian fatalities.
      <br />In the case of Yemen, on the other hand, there has been an increase in protests over the last year. This trend could reflect a period of particular political or social instability in the country. The other states, on the contrary, show more stable levels or no significant changes.
      <br />Comparing these trends allows us to understand not only the significance of individual episodes, but also the deeper dynamics that characterise the evolution of conflicts over time.
